# Compiler

This Compiler compiles ~~python in python~~ ~~c++ in python~~ ~~c in c~~ c in python into my own custom assembly (for [Excpute](https://github.com/LightslicerGP/Excpute)), with JSON files for intermediate steps.

(currently a WIP, this is like my 4th attempt :sob:)

check the `Compiler.py` code to see what to run, in my case its `python Compiler.py Sample.c --debug`
